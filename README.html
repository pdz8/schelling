<h1>SchellingCoin on Ethereum</h1>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<h3>Installing Ethereum</h3>

<p>Instructions for installing cpp-ethereum can be found <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki/Installing%20Clients">here</a>. 
You can then check that everything is installed properly by simply running:</p>

<p><code>
eth -h
</code></p>

<p>The provided link above also gives instructions for building from source. This is also advisable since Ethereum is still under development. Many weird bugs seem to disappear.</p>

<p>The installation gives an assortment of clients and tools. So far we focus mostly on AlethZero (GUI) and <code>eth</code> (CLI).
In the future we will ramp up in Mix, an IDE for Ethereum. It should alleviate many testing inconveniences.</p>

<h3>Creating an account</h3>

<p>The Ethereum clients currently generate a default account upon first use.
For testing purposes however it is useful to generate more accounts.</p>

<p>By far the friendliest way to setup Ethereum accounts is to use one of the GUI clients.
AlethZero is included with cpp-ethereum and can serve this purpose.</p>

<p>It currently seems like the CLI <code>eth</code> is unable to generate accounts past its coinbase.
Thus in order to use it, you must first export keys from AlethZero and pass them as arguments to <code>eth</code>.
Additionally each instance of <code>eth</code> only supports a single account at a time. Thus to run a multi-account scenario one must either use AlethZero or run multiple instances of <code>eth</code>, each listening on a different port.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p>The SchellingCoin backend is currently all Python and needs no special compilation.
We do provide a <code>setup.py</code> to aid with installation. It is run the standard way via:</p>

<p><code>
python setup.py install
</code></p>

<p>If this for some reason fails, the manual installation with <code>pip</code> and moving around files is not difficult.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>Everything but <code>pyethereum</code> works on Windows (TODO: add shocked emoticon). This is a good compromise since <code>pyethereum</code> doesn't work well anywhere.</p>
